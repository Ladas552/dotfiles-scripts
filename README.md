Just posting stuff, might be usefull

Here are descriptions of my stuff:
- Subtitlenator.sh : need ffmpeg : to work
  - Merge every similary named mkv file with respectable .ass subtitle file and create separated folder for the output . For this to work, .mkv files and .ass need to be in one directory. The name of a script is up for change
- MPDinfo.conkyrc : need conky, mpd, mpc : to work
  - Square like conky config to show MPD info about Songs Album, Title, Timebar, Volume of MPD and how many Albums and Songs is now in your database. It can statter at times, I don't know hot to fix it, tried everything on the web to fix it but nothing works.
  - You might want to change to colors and fonts. Colors are kinda too dark for most themes. And Fonts are ugly because I needed readable CJK fonts
